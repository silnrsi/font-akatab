Akatab (“writing”) is designed to reflect a handwriting style and even the “writing in sand” effect. 

Type samples showing an inventory of some of the glyphs and features are available in a PDF sample: [Akatab Type Sample](https://software.sil.org/downloads/r/akatab/Akatab-Character-Inventory.pdf). For a complete list of characters included in Akatab, see [Character Set Support](charset.md).
