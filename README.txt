TIPS
====

Many problems can be solved, or at least explained, through an understanding
of the encoding and use of the fonts. Here are some basic hints:

Encoding: 
The fonts are encoded according to Unicode, so your application must support
Unicode text in order to access letters other than the standard alphabet.
Most Windows applications provide basic Unicode support. You will, however,
need some way of entering Unicode text into your document.

Keyboarding: 
If you cannot use the built-in keyboards of the operating system, you will 
need to install the appropriate keyboard and input method for the characters 
of the language you wish to use. A Windows keyboard installer and 
documentation for Tifinagh is found in the keyboards folder. If you want to 
enter characters that are not supported by any system keyboard, the Keyman 
program (www.tavultesoft.com) can be helpful on Windows systems. Also available 
for Windows is MSKLC (http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/tools/msklc.mspx). For 
other platforms, KMFL (http://kmfl.sourceforge.net/), 
XKB (http://www.x.org/wiki/XKB) or Ukelele (http://scripts.sil.org/ukelele) 
can be helpful.

If you want to enter characters that are not supported by any system keyboard, 
and to access the full Unicode range, we suggest you use gucharmap, kcharselect 
on Ubuntu or similar software. Another method of entering some symbols is 
provided by a few applications such as Adobe InDesign. They can display a glyph 
palette that shows all the glyphs (symbols) in a font and allow you to enter 
them by clicking on the glyph you want.

Rendering:
This font is designed to work with two advanced font technologies, 
Graphite and OpenType. To take advantage of the advanced typographic 
capabilities of this font, you must be using applications that provide an
adequate level of support for Graphite or OpenType.


INSTALLATION AND CONFIGURATION
==============================

If you are not sure how to install the fonts, please consult your operating 
system documentation for instructions on font installation.
