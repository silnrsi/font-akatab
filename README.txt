TIPS
====
As this font is distributed at no cost, we are unable to provide a commercial 
level of personal technical support. The font has, however, been through some 
testing on various platforms to be sure it works in most situations. In 
particular, it has been tested and shown to work on Windows 10. Graphite 
capabilities have been tested on Graphite-supported platforms.

Many problems can be solved, or at least explained, through an understanding
of the encoding and use of the fonts. Here are some basic hints:

Encoding: 
The fonts are encoded according to Unicode, so your application must support
Unicode text in order to access letters other than the standard alphabet.
Most Windows applications provide basic Unicode support. You will, however,
need some way of entering Unicode text into your document.

Keyboarding: 
This font does not include any keyboarding helps or utilities. You may use the
built-in keyboards of the operating system. You may also need to install an
appropriate keyboard and input method for the characters of the language you
wish to use. If you want to enter characters that are not supported by any
system keyboard, the Keyman program (www.keyman.com) can be helpful
on Windows, macOS, and Linux systems. 

If you want to enter characters that are not supported by any system
keyboard, and to access the full Unicode range, you might try charmap.exe
on Windows or, on Ubuntu or similar software, gucharmap or kcharselect.

Another method of entering some symbols is provided by a few applications such
as Adobe InDesign or LibreOffice.org. They can display a glyph palette or input
dialog that shows all the glyphs (symbols) in a font and allow you to enter
them by clicking on the glyph you want.

Rendering:
This font is designed to work with two advanced font technologies, 
Graphite and OpenType. To take advantage of the advanced typographic 
capabilities of this font, you must be using applications that provide an
adequate level of support for Graphite or OpenType.


INSTALLATION AND CONFIGURATION
==============================

If you are not sure how to install the fonts, please consult your operating 
system documentation for instructions on font installation.
