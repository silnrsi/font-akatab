FONTLOG
Akatab
========================

This file provides detailed information on the Akatab family of fonts.
This information should be distributed along with the Akatab fonts and
any derivative works.


Basic Font Information
----------------------

Akatab is a TrueType font with smart font capabilities added using 
state-of-the-art font technologies. This means that complex typographic 
issues such as the placement of combining marks or the formation of ligatures 
are handled by the font, provided you are running an application that provides 
an adequate level of support for one of these smart font technologies.

Andrew Savage is the owner of the Akatab fonts and of all proprietary rights 
therein.


A Note Regarding the Open Font License
----------------------------------------------------

The OFL prohibits the use of Reserved Font Names "Akatab" in the name of 
any font that is derived from the Original Version of Akatab.
